[Note: Time spent and lines of code is meant mostly to track my own progress. Hence, it will not always be present in every entry]

9/18/22 | v0.2
	- In Conjugation.py, switched from using googletrans API to pygoogletranslation API
	- Fixed errors that occured when using pygoogletranslation by modifying the files
	- Working on new plans for conjugating Spanish verbs, as to minimize erros as well as minimize hard-coding/asking the user.
	- Fixed bug where the first line of Dictionary.txt was being read incorrectly, causing program to crash when trying to use those words.
	- Total lines of Python Code: 334
	- Time invested today: ~2 hours

4/25/22 | v0.2
	- changed conjugations.txt to conjugations.yml to improve readability of file
	- might change dictionary.txt in a similar way, but not sure yet
	- Time invested today: < 1 hour
4/24/22 | v0.2
	- Created a text file to act as a cache for conjugations, both speeding up the process and reducing the number of errors due to googletrans
	- When storing a conjugation, the user is asked if it is the right conjugation (to prevent problems when translating back and forth)
	- Users now have to hit any key before Translator.py goes to next 'activity' (e.g. if you're doing sentences, it'll wait until you hit a key to go to the next sentence after you give an answer so you have time to look at the correct answer/see if you wer right)
	- checkfile() and writefile() are their own functional functions, allowing conjugate() to check if a conjugation is already cached (checkfile), and storing it if it is not (writefile)
	- Total lines of Python code: 332
	- Time invested today: ~ 2 hours
4/23/22 | v0.1
	- googletrans is mostly working, but takes a while
	- working on a method to store conjugations in a sort of cache using json (storing in a txt file though; had trouble with .json files)
	- moved conjugate() to its own file to make things easier to read and to keep things more organized (now Conjugation.py)
	- using test() to test out different methods for json and reading/writing to files
4/22/22 | v0.1
	- After a long break, a breakthrough occured: I could just use an already existing translator to make my life a LOT easier
	- Implemented a very simple version of googletrans 4.0.0
	- will keep a backup of the old code so I have it if I need it, but will likely restructure and clean up most of the code now
1/24/22 | v0.1
	- removed hard-coded dictionary and added dictionary.txt 
	- added methods to extract dictionary from dictionary.txt and use it as normal dictionary (this doesn't sound like a lot but it took a long time and I'm happy I got it to work)
	- changed "while not input" slightly so that it detects when the input changes at all, not when it's false. This allows hitting "enter" to also break the loop
1/23/22 | v0.1
	- slight optimization with conjugation()\n
    - made flashcards() and langmodeselect() into their own functions (they were part of main() before)
	- added confirmation before exiting program
	- added "while not input()" loops for informaton (i.e. changelog) so that users can indicate when they are ready to move on
	- made "the" not count (i.e. "the wolf" used to be counted wrong for "el lobo" because it expected only "wolf", but now it is also right)
	- slightly improved readability of script (added comments, organized things better, etc.)
	- total number of lines: 259
1/21/22 | v0.1
	- main() implemented, with 5 functions so far (Start, View Words, View English Words, Practice Sentences, and Changelog
	- Basic present tense conjugation implemented
	- 3 sentences implemented, using a combination of random nouns, verbs, and subjects
	- small list of irregular verbs added, along with easy way to use them
	- 11 words total added (mostly wanted to focus on code before adding words)
	- added langmode to allow only english->spanish or vice versa if desired
	- total number of lines: 209
